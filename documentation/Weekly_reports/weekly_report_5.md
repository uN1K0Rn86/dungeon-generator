# Weekly Report 5

## What Have I Done / Learned This Week

- I wrote unit tests to verify that Prim's algorithm works as it should.

- I wrote tests for the A* algorithm.

- Fixed a bug with the heuristic function for A*.

- Made changes to the UI to include the final product of the dungeon after running the A* algorithm.

- Made changes to the visual outputs so that it looks nicer with hallways.

## What Was Unclear and / or Difficult

The most difficult part this week was coming up with representative test cases to verify each algorithm. I used ChatGPT for this and had a discussion with a teacher, which was very productive.

Additionally, I had some difficulties with plotting hallways in matplotlib.

## Next Steps

- Further testing for Bowyer-Watson: a test that verifies that the graph that the algorithm outputs is continuous and a test that verifies that the number of triangles is correct.

- Polishing the UI and visual output.

- Reviewing and improving code readability if necessary.

## Time Tracking

| Date | What Was Done | Time Used |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| 10.4 | Writing tests | 2h |
| 11.4 | Tests, UI changes, bug fixes, brainstorming | 4h |
| Total | | 6h |

## Sources and LLM usage

- ChatGPT was used for brainstorming how to test Prim's algorithm.
