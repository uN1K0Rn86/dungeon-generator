# Weekly Report 1

## What Have I Done / Learned This Week

I attended the initial lecture and spent time thinking about which topic to choose. While many of them seemed interesting, I landed on dungeon generation. It seems like a challenging topic that can be nicely split into smaller tasks, and the algorithms used are interesting.

I spent significant time researching how dungeons can be generated and familiarizing myself with some of the algorithms that are commonly used. I did not have time to do any actual implementation, but I feel confident that I have a good general idea of what I need to accomplish to make this projcect work.

I initialized a Github repository for the project and registered in Labtool. I created the project specification document and spent time planning how to implement the different algorithms and make the project an actuality. I installed poetry and the first development dependencies.

## What Was Unclear and / or Difficult

I have a good idea of how to proceed with the project, but i am unsure about the specifics of the algorithms. I expect at least some difficulty in implementation.

## Next Steps

To me it makes the most sense to start with implementing the visual representation and room placement. This way, I will have a way to see what the program actually does and I will be able to evaluate my progress.
