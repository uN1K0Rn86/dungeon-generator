## What Have I Done / Learned This Week

I created a basic visual output to depict what the dungeon looks like. This was a necessary first step so I can visualize what the algorithms actually do. I decided to use a list of lists as a data structure to represent the dungeon, because it makes it easy to modify single tiles.

I created a basic room generator that randomly generates rooms based on user input. I also created an algorithm to place randomly generated rooms into a dungeon.

I made a rudimentary user interface. The user can specify the maximum width and height of a single room, the total amount of rooms, and the width and height of the dungeon.
