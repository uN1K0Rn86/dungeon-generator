# Weekly Report 6

## What Have I Done / Learned This Week

- Fixed bugs and made other changes based on peer feedback.

- Made changes to Bowyer-Watson testing to make it more robust.

- Worked on the demonstration.

## What Was Unclear and / or Difficult

I found a bug by chance that revealed that in some cases, the algorithm was not including all points in the triangulation. Finding the cause was quite difficult, but eventually I discovered that it was because the super triangle's bottom edge contained one of the points. The bug was fixed by making the super triangle larger.

## Next Steps

Finalizing the program and polishing the demonstration.
